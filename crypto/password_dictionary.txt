I tried multiple word lists, dictionaries, and common password files on the internet. 
Name of some of the files that I checked: 
hashash.in-wordlist.txt
wordlist_by_Kakoluk.txt
real_englis.txt
cracklib-words-20080507.txt
common-passwords.txt
uniqpass_preview.txt
rockyou.txt
wordlist.txt
rockyou75.txt
10_million_password_list_top_10000.txt
1337speak.txt
top_shortlist.txt
wordpress_attacks_july2014.txt
myspace.txt
openwall_all.txt
elitehacker.txt
hashes.txt

For the extra credit, I created a python file that run through text file and return a list of words in new line. After that, I tested all of the course webpage, the pdf, the VM instruction, the project descriptions. And I found that project 1 has the extra credits.
