1/ Bitcoin is an electronic payment system, is considered as a new currency, and there's going to be fluctuation. It is used by two parties that maybe unknown to each other in the real world, or  and just want to make the payment entirely through the internet. Bitcoin is a form of payment and the payment that are sent will have certain mathematical properties. These properties will make it hard for someone to really defraud the system. 

2/ - Symmetric encryption: It's used to encrypting data on a server/computer but not great for communication. The two parties somehow have to agree on the same key to generate the transaction. As the result, the user usually have to share his public key, by posting it on a keyserver or a website. Anyone can download it and use it to encrypts bitcoin to send to him. After that, they can only decrypted with the corresponding private key. Symmetric encryption is used for proof of work, miners given challenge problem.  
 - Hash function is a methematical function that turns a large amount of data into a fixed length hash. It is used to validate transactions. The same hash always transform into the same result. Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hash algorithm and user generates the hash with a value less than the current target. Also, the hash can help user to achieve the digital signature schemes.
  - Asymmetric encryption: This encryption secures transactions and accounts instead of messages. The user can generate digital signature to authorize the transaction on bitcoin. At no time are bitcoins sent as files or messages to the new address' rather announcing the change in the ownership's transaction to the entire network, which is recorded by miners into the blockchain. It's even possible to use bitcoin to sign a message, so people can use bitcoin to prove their ownership of a certain address. Asymmetric encryption for both public key and private key. They need private key to sign with data corresponding to other person's public key. This is verified on the network. 

Attack against bitcoin:
- an old copy of wallet with its old password is often retrieved through back up file. So bitcoin works the same way, people can trace a coin's history and use to track down the person, destroying the purpose of using bitcoin as anonymous. This is a problem of confientiality. Private information is compromised, so people can impersonate others to do the transaction and the victims will suffer.
