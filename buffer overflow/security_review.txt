Although 3D printing (also known as additive manufacturing) technology was first invented in the 1980s, it has started to evolve into a next-generation technology that has the potential to radically transform many design, production and logistic processes. 3D printable models maybe created with a computer-aided design (CAD) package, via a 3D scanner, or by a plain digital camera and photography software. 
Assets:
-	One clear asset that needs to be protected is the counterfeit and license of other products. The 3D printer are made for inspired customers to create DIY products faster. However, the benefit of the printer is slashing the time from product development to market-ready product to a matter of hours and require less materials. 
-	Another asset is about the safety of the customers. 3D printed guns have illustrated the public safety and security risks of this technology. There are no regulations from the government to prevent this. And even if it does, it’s hard to prevent the printing since people can easily purchase it and try it at home. 
Security threat:
-	The printers sometimes require software update, usually either through Wi-Fi, cable, or manual update. When one company tries to have their machine update, a hacker from other company can use the network to gain access to the system internal and steal the product’s design. In a short time, the product can be introduced to the market by before the original company does. This can leads to bankrupt of lots of companies. 
-	The usage of guns are really dangerous, even with 3D plastic guns. Technology is improved better and better, so it’s getting easier to 3D print more advanced guns. Moreover, those guns can bypass the metal detector, or x-ray machine, so they could be easily to transfer through countries. 
Defense:
-	Companies can set up password or authorization code to open the file. Another measurement would be to put authorized print jobs – a type of watermark on the designs. More than that, as technology advances, more and more of printing materials come into use. It could be possible to limit the supply of materials to better control over the #d printed products. 
-	The law Undetectable Firearms Act was renewed by President Obama in 2013. The law was created to make illegal firearms that is not detectable by a walk-through metal detector. Other countries already ban the production and distribution of such weapons. 

Risk / Conclusion: 
Although 3D printing is good for customers to use to develop their own idea on building something new, it’s very dangerous when people try using it the wrong way. As mentioned above, for the first security (counterfeit product), hacker can still hack into the system through company’s wi-fi and pass through the password link / authorization code by using buffer overflow/ code injection. So the company has to develop a good programming team to take part on that problem. However, most of company that use 3D printer is small, so it would be difficult for them to invest in a programming team.
The second risk for the non-metal gun is that it’s hard to detect the weapons that people carry. Also, because of the advanced technology right now, users can make the gun to be small but still have a large impact on others. The government has to invent machine in order to detect those printing material. However, the other problem is that more and more printing materials come out in the market, so user can choose the rare one to use, make it harder to secure. 
In conclusion, 3D printing gives both advantages and disadvantages to users according to their purpose of using it. The current state security of the 3D printing right now is in medium level. The company should make more effort to prevent the risk to customers.
